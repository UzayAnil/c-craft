# ccraft

The start of a minecraft clone written in plain C. My friend [Dan](https://github.com/danlshields) and I made it in a sort of "game jam" of about 12 hours.

The project is very incomplete but the foundations of the voxel world work well and are much more effecient than the real game.

It was written to run on Mac, but can probably be easily adapted for other programs.

It requires [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org)
